# accessing-the-dream-interface
how to access your dream/brain interface.

-------
please lay down anywhere that is actually the most comfortable to you that makes you want to fall asleep. 
now close your eyes and imagine a rectangular box now put imagine the sky, at night, pitch dark, in the middle of the forest, in a open area, the forest is encircling you but far away as to not to block the view from the sky, you're facing the sky and you see stars you see stars, a shooting star passes by, now in this rectangle, now in this circle imagine the ideas visually, is it a new video game idea, maybe a movie you were thinking about making? is fleeting if you lose your pertinent focus on it, so be careful and write the things after down after do imagine your idea and formulate with other ideas and if it dont work or suits take it off and try other ideas that peak your interest, you will know its working if you're almost falling asleep but still awake but feel like you're about to it will actually feel like your dreaming actually,
